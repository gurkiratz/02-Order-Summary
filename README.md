### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to look back and polish my CSS skills. These include:
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Background images

Infact, the final product came out so beautiful, even I doubted my skills at first but continuing to write the code and practising at intervals made me feel like I can do it.
